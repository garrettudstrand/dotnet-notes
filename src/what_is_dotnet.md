# What is .NET?

When you start trying to use C#, F#, or .NET, the first and most confusing hurdle in my experience is understanding what anything means. 

For example, the first time I got exposed to the .NET ecosystem and everything surrounding it was a couple of years ago. I decided that I wanted to make a C# application. Being a developer with some experience, I knew that C# was a compiled language similar to Java in some aspects. So, I expected to find some sort of SDK, maybe something equivalent to the JVM, and a compiler. Imagine my confusion when I found out that I had to install something called .NET, and instead of this ".NET" being some clear analogue to something else I've used, it was called a "...free, open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern apps and powerful cloud services" ([.NET | Build. Test. Deploy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)). I thought I was being re-directed to some paid service or some weighty framework that I didn't want to use, and tried desparately to find the "real" barebones C#.

Eventually, I learned that .NET is a critical piece of the "real" C# for most developers, but, even after I accepted that, there was a barage of different technologies and terms that confused me because they all sounded similar. Why does some documentation reference .NET, while others reference .NET full framework and others still reference .NET Core? What is ADO.NET? What is ASP, and is it the same as ASP.NET? What is ASP.NET Core? Is that the same as ASP.NET? What is Entity Framework Core? Is that the same as Entity Framework? And, what does Dapper have to do with that?

Essentailly, there was a lot of new stuff to take in, and a lot of it didn't make sense to me. And, I think it's reasonable if it doesn't make sense to other newcomers, or even people who have been using .NET related stuff for awhile. So, to make everything easier, I'm going to do my best in this section to clarify the differences between all of these similarly named technologies, what their purpose is and a little bit of the history surrounding them to make the origin of these confusing names a bit more clear
